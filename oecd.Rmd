## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Loading the required libraries first:

```{r cars}
install.packages("car")
library(haven)
library(car)
```

```{r}
oecd = read.table("oecd_mexico.txt", header = TRUE, dec = ",")
rownames(oecd)=oecd$region
oecd<-oecd[,-1]
head(oecd)
```

```{r}
summary(oecd)
```

Standardizing the columns of our data frame (making each column have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). This ensures that all variables contribute equally to the analysis and prevents variables with larger scales from dominating the results.

```{r}
summary(scale(oecd))
```

## Performing hierarchical clustering on the normalized data

Calculating the Euclidean distances between rows of the `scale(oecd)`, creating a distance matrix. The resulting **`ds`** object represents the pairwise distances between rows.

```{r}
ds<-dist(scale(oecd))
print(ds)
```

The next chunk of code defines a function named **`agglo`** that takes a hierarchical clustering result (**`hc`**) as an argument and returns a data frame summarizing the clustering.

```{r}
agglo <- function(hc){
      data.frame(row.names=paste0("Cluster",seq_along(hc$height)),
            height=hc$height,
            components=ifelse(hc$merge<0, 
  hc$labels[abs(hc$merge)], paste0("Cluster",hc$merge)),
                  stringsAsFactors=FALSE) }
```

The next code results in a multi-panel plot where the first panel contains the dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering using average linkage, and the second panel displays the summary information about the clustering obtained from the **`agglo`** function.

```{r}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 3))                  
### average linkage
h1<-hclust(ds, method="average")
agglo(h1)
```

```{r}
plot(h1, main="average linkage")
```

Let's repeat the same for complete and ward linkage methods.

```{r}
### complete linkage
h2<-hclust(ds, method="complete")
agglo(h2)

```

```{r}
plot(h2, main="complete linkage")
```

Legame ward:

```{r}
### legame ward
h3<-hclust(ds, method="ward.D2")
agglo(h3)
```

```{r}
plot(h3, main="Ward linkage")
```

Assigning cluster memberships for k=5 using cutree for each linkage method. This comparison allows us to assess the similarity or dissimilarity between the cluster assignments obtained from two linkage methods for 5 clusters.

```{r}
average <- cutree(h1, k=5)
complete<- cutree(h2, k=5)
ward<- cutree(h3, k=5)
table(average,complete)
```

Looking at the diagonal cells (from top-left to bottom-right), these represent observations that are assigned to the same cluster by both methods. Off-diagonal cells represent observations that are assigned to different clusters by the two methods.

```{r}
table(average,ward)
```

```{r}
table(complete,ward)
```

```{r}
### dendrograms
plot(h1, main="Complete linkage")
rect.hclust(h2, 5)
h2cluster <- cutree(h2, k=5)
h2cluster
plot(oecd, col=h2cluster, main="complete likage")
```
