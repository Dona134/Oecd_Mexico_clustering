# Oecd_Mexico_clustering
Hierarchical Clustering and Comparison
 This repository contains R code for performing hierarchical clustering on standardized OECD data using different linkage methods (average, complete, and ward.D2). The script includes dendrogram plotting, cluster summarization, and a comparison of cluster assignments between the average and ward.D2 linkage methods for k=5 clusters.




Key Components:
- `hclust` with average, complete, and ward.D2 linkage methods
- Dendrogram plotting using `plot`
- Cluster summarization with `agglo` function
- Comparison of cluster assignments using `cutree` and a contingency table

Note: Ensure that the necessary R packages (e.g., 'stats', 'cluster') are installed before running the script.
