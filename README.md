# Oecd_Mexico_clustering
 This repository contains R code for performing hierarchical clustering on standardized OECD data using different linkage methods (average, complete, and ward.D2). The script includes dendrogram plotting, cluster summarization, and a comparison of cluster assignments between the average and ward.D2 linkage methods for k=5 clusters.
